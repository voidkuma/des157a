            <h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>
            <p>
                For this journal entry, I read “Best Practices for Form Design” by Salim Ansari and wanted to share the points that stood out to me the most. I really liked Ansari’s idea of “less is more,” especially when it comes to respecting the user’s time and patience. This is very important because not a lot of people want to fill out a form with their free time.

                As someone who often fills out forms for research credits, I notice that many forms tend to be long and thus exhaustive. By including only the most important questions, designers can make the process faster, reduce mental strain, and still collect meaningful responses as responders keep their motivation high. I also appreciated his advice to clearly explain formatting requirements and use helpful placeholder text, so users aren’t left confused which could cause frustration and/or abandonment of the form. In relation he mentioned putting easy questions first, which makes sense. Asking for less in the beginning eases people in before asking for more effort or detail later.

                Another practice that made a lot of sense to me was keeping forms in a single column. Multiple columns can be confusing and make the layout feel cluttered. I also found the idea of breaking longer forms into multiple steps really interesting. It helps users see their progress and gives them a sense of control over the process. Overall, Ansari’s points made me realize how thoughtful design practices can change the way we see filling out forms and make them into a smoother, easier experience.

                        One online form I recently interacted with is the BenefitsCal application for CalFresh, which walks you through a series of questions to determine if you qualify for EBT. I think this form exemplifies best practices because it uses a simple one-column layout, clearly marks your progress, and provides straightforward steps explaining what information is needed and how it will be used. In my opinion it’s very direct and easy to follow.
