            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                After reviewing the peer feedback I received, I realized that my project could benefit from diving deeper into the narrative and personal connection behind my content. For future iterations, I plan to take a more personal approach by inviting viewers into my workspace  allowing them to explore my desk and interact with various items to learn about their purpose and meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                To develop this idea, I created several sketches of how the final website might look. I’m also exploring different JavaScript and CSS techniques to enhance the storytelling aspect of the project. Some potential features include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Using a carousel to display a sequence of images in a more dynamic and engaging way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implementing image mapping so users can click on specific objects on my desk to reveal more information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adding subtle animation, such as my avatar guiding viewers as they scroll through the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Refining the hover overlay transitions for smoother and more visually consistent alignment.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These changes aim to make the project feel more interactive, meaningful, and uniquely tied to my own creative process.
            </p>
            <h3>Concerns & next steps:</h3>
            <p>
                I can’t wait to get started on this project. I think my only concern is making sure I can apply the skills I’ve learned in class while keeping the overall experience cohesive and story-driven rather than choppy.
